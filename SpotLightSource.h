/**
 * \brief Light emitted from a Point in a limited range of Directions.
 *
 * A SpotLightSource represents light emitted from a point in the Scene,
 * but which only illuminates in a cone.
 * The amount of light that reaches any given part of the scene should follow
 * a \f$1/r^2\f$ law, so more distant Objects receive less illumination, much like PointLightSource.
 * However, a SpotLightSource also has a Direction, and an angle property. 
 * Only objects that are within the specified angle of the SpotLightSource's Direction should be illuminated.
 *
 * This creates the effect of a cone of light, as shown in the illustration below. A SpotLightSource
 * at some location, \b p, illuminates a cone around the direction, \b d. Only the parts of an object 
 * within some angle \f$\theta\f$ of that direction are illuminated. There is no illumination from
 * the SpotLightSource outside of the cone (black shading in the illustration). Note that within the
 * cone parts of an Object can still be shadowed (grey shading) like any other LightSource.
